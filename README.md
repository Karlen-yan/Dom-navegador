# Dom-navegador
The exercise aims to implement navigation and selection functionality within a checkbox using JavaScript and the browser's Document Object Model (DOM). Allows the user to select individual cells, entire rows, and entire columns, visually highlighting the selections and displaying the path of the selected item. Also included is the ability to move the selection using the arrow keys on the keyboard. In summary, the exercise focuses on interaction with the checkerboard and provides a way to visually explore and manipulate the items within it.
